This is basically the source code of the application found in:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kapouta.asudokube


You'll need to open three projects:
ASudoKube
AurubikLib (a generic library to manipulate 3x3x3 cubes)
KATools (https://github.com/feiteira/KATools - An upgrade on Android Analytics Lib v1) - this may be removed with litle refactoring, simply replace all "extends KActivity" with"extends Activity"

Enjoy and good luck!
